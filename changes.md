Pokédex Project Changes Report

This report outlines the differences between the initial and finalized versions of the Pokédex web app, categorized into Visual Changes, Technical Changes, and Other Changes. It includes major additions like default cards and minor enhancements.

Visual Changes

1. Updated header to "POKÉDEX" with "Gotta Catch 'Em All!" subtitle, using retro fonts and glowing effects.
2. Added animated gradient background and floating particles.
3. Enhanced search section with blurred backdrop, neon borders, and focus effects.
4. Introduced default Pokémon cards (e.g., Pikachu, Charizard, Blastoise) with images, hover effects, and retro styling—absent in initial version.
5. Replaced dark mode toggle with a consistent neon-themed design.
6. Improved stats display with animated progress bars and icons.
7. Added styled error messages with emojis, suggestion buttons, and ripple effects.
8. Optimized mobile layouts with touch-friendly adjustments, media queries, and no-zoom inputs.
9. Added dedicated All Pokémon page with grid layout of Pokémon cards.
10. Styled sticky topbar with brand link, search bar, and controls matching neon theme.
11. Introduced hover and focus effects for grid cards and detail views to match existing retro styling.

Technical Changes

1. Added Pokémon ID database (first 1010 Pokémon).
2. Enhanced input validation: trim whitespace, handle numeric IDs with padding, and specific errors for empty searches, timeouts, offline.
3. Improved API fetch: added 15s timeout with AbortController, JSON headers, and fallback images (shiny, official artwork, or placeholder).
4. Added event listeners: Enter key for search (missing in initial), clicks/touch for buttons/cards, keyboard shortcuts (Esc back, Ctrl+K focus).
5. Implemented default card loading on click, back to home functionality, and name capitalization utility.
6. Added network status detection (online/offline), ripple effects on buttons, and mobile optimizations (tap-highlight, touch-action).
7. Expanded error handling: custom UIs for not found (with suggestions), empty search, timeout, no connection.
8. Added particles creation on load and console logs for shortcuts/debugging.
9. Created separate full_pokedex.js for handling infinite scroll, search, and detail loading.
10. Created separate full_pokedex.css for styling the All Pokémon page, keeping code modular.
11. Implemented batch loading of Pokémon from API with IntersectionObserver and “Load More” button fallback.
12. Added in-page deep linking with hashes (e.g., #25 opens detail for Pikachu).

Other Changes

1. Added .particles div, default cards container, and error containers in HTML.
2. Imported retro fonts (Orbitron, Press Start 2P) in CSS.
3. Removed initial dark mode code; added new animations, keyframes, and utilities.
4. Restructured project to include pages/ folder with full_pokedex.html, full_pokedex.js, and full_pokedex.css.
5. Updated relative paths and imports to support new modular layout.

Profiling and Performance Changes

1. Profiled `findSimilarIds` to find repeated `toString()` calls as a CPU hotspot when run repeatedly (e.g., live search). Added a cached-string fast path for the default `POKEMON_IDS` to reduce per-call allocations and conversions.
2. Added a benchmark script `test/perf/benchmark_findSimilarIds.js` that compares a baseline implementation with the optimized function and prints timing for a fixed number of runs.
3. Added a small test helper (mock) to `test/pokemonDom.test.js` to silence a jsdom "Not implemented: window.scrollTo" message during automated tests.
4. Measured improvement: baseline ~345.78ms → optimized ~298.66ms for 20,000 runs (local results); correctness preserved.
5. Files touched: `utils/pokemonUtils.js`, `test/pokemonUtils.test.js`, `test/pokemonDom.test.js`, `test/perf/benchmark_findSimilarIds.js`.
